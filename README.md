## 📌 Overview

Agent Forge OS is an automated AI agent creation and deployment platform that processes unstructured logs, invoices, and logistical narratives, then intelligently routes data payloads across live Google Workspace instances and secure SMTP networks.

The platform utilizes a customized **Traffic Cop Execution Framework** to:

- Parse incoming data streams
- Map authorized endpoints via persistent blueprint storage
- Enforce tool-level security boundaries
- Execute concurrent operations across:
  - Google Sheets
  - Google Docs
  - Google Slides
  - SMTP Email Systems

Agent Forge OS bridges the gap between conversational AI and real-world operational tooling where traditional automation pipelines struggle with variable document formats.

---

## 🏆 Hackathon Context

Built during the **InFynd Agent OS Hackathon**.

The project demonstrates autonomous workflow compilation, dynamic tool authorization, and secure execution using configurable AI agents.

---

# ✨ Core Features

## Dynamic Tool Blueprinting

Users create specialized agents through Agent Studio by defining:

- Agent identity
- Operational purpose
- Behavioral constraints
- Authorized tool permissions

---

## Traffic Cop Router

A secure orchestration layer that:

- Validates incoming payloads
- Checks agent permissions
- Restricts tool access
- Routes execution requests safely

---

## Context-Aware UI Rendering

The interface dynamically adapts based on the selected agent blueprint.

Examples:

- Google Sheets agent → Show spreadsheet fields
- Email agent → Show SMTP configuration
- Docs agent → Show document configuration

---

## Automated Tabular Extraction

Extracts structured financial data from unstructured text and updates:

- Google Sheets
- Pandas DataFrames
- Financial summaries

---

## Automated Document Stitching

Generates formatted narrative reports and operational summaries directly into:

- Google Docs

---

## Presentation Generation

Automatically creates structured presentation slides using:

- Google Slides API

---

## Automated SMTP Dispatch

Extracts contacts, builds tailored email content, and sends messages through secure SMTP channels.

---

# 🔄 Workflow Pipeline

## Step 1 — Agent Creation

Developers configure:

- Agent identity
- Purpose
- Behavioral rules
- Tool permissions

---

## Step 2 — Dynamic UI Adaptation

The interface reads the blueprint and displays only the fields required for that workflow.

---

## Step 3 — File Ingestion

Supported inputs:

- Invoices
- Reports
- Event Documents
- Operational Logs

---

## Step 4 — Autonomous Execution
